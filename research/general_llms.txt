I'm going to analyze why and how there are some domain-related knowledge recall, 
such as: retrospect question-related principles/theorems/axioms and other types of knowledge, 
steps within the large language models (LLMs) reasoning process.
I prefer to delve into the LLMs' inner parameters or the inference process to figure out why and how such a phenomenon can happen. 
Could you investigate all the related research papers in a detailed manner and write a very related and comprehensive survey on this topic? 
It would be better if you could provide a few appropriate analysis algorithms alongside the survey
